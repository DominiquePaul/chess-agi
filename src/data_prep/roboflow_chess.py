"""
The Roboflow has labels that has an additional class for "bishop" that is not present in the images. To align the labels with the standard YOLOv8 format, this script will remove the "bishop" class and shift the class IDs of the remaining classes down by 1.

Original:

  0: bishop
  1: black-bishop
  2: black-king
  3: black-knight
  4: black-pawn
  5: black-queen
  6: black-rook
  7: white-bishop
  8: white-king
  9: white-knight
  10: white-pawn
  11: white-queen
  12: white-rook


New:

  0: black-bishop
  1: black-king
  ...
  11: white-rook


We also update the paths in the data.yaml
